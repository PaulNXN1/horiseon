## Description 

For the first homework assignment, or submission, I was given a fully written HTML and CSS code sheet that created a website.
However, the point of this assignment was to implement Week / Module 1 learning materials to mitigate code.
With code mitigation, several, separate selectors [class/id] were broken down, creating a more clean CSS IDE environment. 

For example - several classes could be named the same term, such as "file" for this specific code.  
The selector "file" has three different separate names and CSS codes.  This was mitigated to one for efficiency and cleanliness. 
Please see line 109 in the include CSS code.  


## Code Contributors
The project was completed by each student.  This was completed by Paul Nixon. 


## User Story 
A pre-written HTML & CSS file were provided. The assignment is to mitigate code for efficiency.  


## Acceptance Criteria
It is DONE when the website is EXACTLY the same, however with updated, simplified programming.
